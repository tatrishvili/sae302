## Narrative Arc

### Progression of Self-Doubt:
1. **Scene 3:** "Everyone looks so good... maybe I should pick my best one"
   - Focus: Selection and slight retouching
   
2. **Scene 4:** "The original looks a bit off... Maybe I should edit it more this time"
   - Focus: Intensive retouching and face modifications
   - Escalation: Rejection of original appearance

### Editing Intensity Progression:
- **First Post:** Basic filters (brightness, blur, warm/cool/vintage tones)
- **Second Post:** Advanced modifications (smoothing, skin tone, saturation, contrast)

*This parallels the documentary's theme: initial social media use seems harmless, but quickly escalates into more intensive and manipulative practices.*

## Connection to Documentary Theme

The implementation of Scene 4 visually demonstrates:

1. **Normalization:** First post seems innocent, but leads to...
2. **Escalation:** More intensive editing tools become available
3. **Self-Comparison:** Justine questions her original appearance
4. **Addiction:** UI encourages "post another" immediately after
5. **Disconnection:** The beauty tools don't match reality

This is the critical moment where Justine's usage pattern shifts from casual to compulsive, setting up the anxiety and comparison sections that follow.
